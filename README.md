# Malaria_detection
This is a malaria detection problem. This model takes the image of cell and predicts whether the cell is uninfected or parasite.  <br />
This solution is based on the transfer learning and I used VGG19 in this.

# Running the model
For running the model i suggest you to make a new python environment and install the requirements.txt file 
After installing the requirement.txt run the "malariadetection.py".
A model will create which I used in the streamlit app for making the prediction

# Some useful commands
Creating a new env - "conda create -n env_name python=3.6"
Activating the environmrnt - "activate env_name"
Installing the requirements.txt - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Running the malariadetection.py - "python malariadetection.py"
Running the app.py - "streamlit run app.py"
